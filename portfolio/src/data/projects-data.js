      "My team developed a Vegetable Trade Platform to efficiently connect local farmers with retailers. Using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, I implemented backend APIs for many part in projects. Additionally, I contributed to the frontend development, building interfaces for web. The frontend consumed backend APIs, including integration with Gemini AI APIs for Chatbot. This project gave me hands-on experience in full-stack development, API integration with third-party services, and AI-assisted features, while improving my problem-solving and teamwork skills.",

    description:
      "I developed a Music Web application where users can browse, stream, and manage their favorite tracks. The project was built using Java Servlets and JSP for the frontend and backend logic, with SQL Server for data storage. I focused on creating dynamic and responsive web pages and integrating backend logic to handle user authentication, playlist management, and music streaming. This project enhanced my full-stack development skills, particularly in Servlet/JSP development, database integration, and delivering a seamless user experience.",
